# ♻️ AI Waste Classifier  
### Sustainable Cities & Communities (SDG 11)

An AI-powered solution to classify waste as **Recyclable, Biodegradable, or Hazardous** using image uploads or text descriptions.  
Built for the **Global AI Buildathon 2025**.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload a **waste image** → AI model predicts category.  
- Enter a **description (e.g., "banana peel")** → Text-based classification.  
- Disposal **tips & icons** for each category.  
- Lightweight model (MobileNetV2 / TensorFlow.js) → runs fast on web/mobile.  
- Deployed demo accessible online.

## 🌍 Impact
- **Problem:** Cities generate massive amounts of waste daily, but segregation into dry, wet, and hazardous categories is often neglected.  
- **Solution:** AI Waste Classifier enables quick and accurate waste classification, helping municipalities improve sorting, NGOs/schools raise awareness, and households dispose waste responsibly.**.  
- **SDG Alignment:**  
  - **SDG 11:** Sustainable Cities & Communities  
  - **SDG 12:** Responsible Consumption & Production  
  - **SDG 13:** Climate Action  
- Reduces landfill waste, increases recycling, and prevents hazardous exposure.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (image upload, text input, results UI)  
- **Backend:** Flask / FastAPI (optional, if not using TF.js)  
- **Model:** MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning) / TensorFlow.js  
- **Dataset:** [Kaggle – Waste Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data)  
- **Deployment:** Render / Hugging Face Spaces / Vercel  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User uploads an image OR enters waste description.  
2. AI Model (MobileNetV2) predicts → **Recyclable / Biodegradable / Hazardous**.  
3. App shows result with icon + disposal instructions.
